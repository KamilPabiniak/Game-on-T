## Core Game Concept

**Tetris Multiplayer Test**  is a minimalist two-player game inspired by the classic Tetris. The game emphasizes smooth, physics-based movement of falling tetrominoes and cooperation between two players on a shared board.

## Game Mechanics

- Smooth physics-based motion:**.  
  Tetromino drops continuously using the Unity physics engine, resulting in smooth real-time movement instead of rigid grid-based steps.

- Two-player interaction:**  
  Two players (blue and red). Each player has a dedicated set of controls to manage their tetrominoes on their respective sides of the board. Players have interactions with each other to change controls or rotate tetrominoes.

- Appearance and placement of the tetromino:**.  
  A random tetromino shape is generated for each player, ensuring the correct positions for rebirth. When the tetromino can no longer move, it is immobilized on the board.

- Row removal and scoring:**.  
  Fully filled rows are removed from the board, for which points are awarded. As the game progresses, the overall falling speed gradually increases, which adds to the challenge.

- Separation of tasks:**  
  The game logic (movement, physics, board management) is separated from the user interface. The user interface displays a preview of the next tetromino, the current score and player names, providing a clean and clear interface.
